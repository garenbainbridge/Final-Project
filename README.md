BIOS 4801 Final Project

HEP_window_means.csv is the Excel file containing my dataset for this project.

Response variable: HEP waveform amplitude
Fixed effects: trial condition, time window
Random effects: participant, trial order


Research Question: Does the high incline condition lead to greater increased mean heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) amplitude in the 250-400ms time window compared to the 50-250ms time window?

Hypothesis: High incline condition (6°) trials will show a higher mean HEP amplitude than the low incline (0°) and the medium incline (3°) conditions.
