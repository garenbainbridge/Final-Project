# Heartbeat Evoked Potentials Under Physical Load
BIOS 4801 Final Project

Response variable: HEP waveform amplitude
Fixed effects: trial condition, time window
Random effects: participant, trial order

For this project, the research question I am asking is "Does the high incline condition lead to greater increased mean heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) amplitude in the 250-400ms time window compared to the 50-250ms time window"? From this question, I have developed a hypothesis that will act as the basis of my analysis. My hypothesis is "High incline condition (6°) trials will show a higher mean HEP amplitude than the low incline (0°) and the medium incline (3°) conditions". To test the hypotheis, I fitted my data set to two different linear mixed-effect models and compared the two to determine which fit the data structure better.

The data contains information regarding recorded physiological signals collected from human participants. It was collected in the Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute on the Georgia Institute of Technology campus. I got the data from my thesis project where I averaged EEG and ECG data together to obtain mean HEP values for each participant.
