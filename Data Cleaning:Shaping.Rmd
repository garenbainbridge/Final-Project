## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r data}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r data}
HEP_data <- read_csv("HEP_window_means.csv")
glimpse(HEP_data)
```
```{r data}
#Transforms the HEP_window_means.csv dataset into long format.
long_HEPdata <- HEP_data %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = matches("ms_ch"),
    names_to = c("Time_Window", "Channel"),
    # Names_pattern splits the window_channel column names into separate columns (50-250ms_ch3     → 50-250ms + ch3)
    names_pattern = "(.*ms)_(ch.*)",
    values_to = "HEP_mean_value"
  )

write.csv(long_HEPdata, "long_HEPdata.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
