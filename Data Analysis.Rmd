## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r Data}
library(tidyverse)
library(lme4)
library(nlme)
library(lmerTest)
```
```{r Data}
long_HEPdata <- read.csv("long_HEPdata.csv")
glimpse(long_HEPdata)
```
```{r Data}
#Make categorical predictor variables into factors, so the model treats them correctly.
long_HEPdata <- long_HEPdata %>%
  mutate(
    Subject = factor(Participant),
    Time_Window = factor(Time_Window),
    Channel = factor(Channel)
  )
```

```{r Data}
#Generates a basic mixed effects model, giving random intercepts to each participant.
model1 <- lmer(
  HEP_mean_value ~ Time_Window + Channel + (1 | Participant),
  data = long_HEPdata
)
print(model1)
```
