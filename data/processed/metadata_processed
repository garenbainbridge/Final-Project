The processed data file has been transformed into long format and had the Participant, Time Window, and Channel variables mutated into factors.
# Columns:

Participant: unique identifier for each participant data was collected from; WS001-WS015 (1st to 15th participant)
Condition: low_trial_1: first trial of low treadmill incline (0°)
           low_trial_2: second trial of low treadmill incline (0°)
           med_trial_1: first trial of medium treadmill incline (3°)
           med_trial_2: second trial of medium treadmill incline (3°)
           high_trial_1: first trial of high treadmill incline (6°)
           high_trial_2: second trial of high treadmill incline (6°)
50-250ms_mean_over_channels: mean data of first time window from electrode channels #3, #4, #12, & #13
